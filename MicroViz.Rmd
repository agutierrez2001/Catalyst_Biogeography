## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(stringr)
   library(ggplot2)
   library(dplyr)
   library(tidyr)
   library(tibble)
   library(readr)
   library(maps)
   library(glue)
library("Cairo")
library("cairoDevice")
   library(phyloseq)
library("readxl")
library("openxlsx")
library("gplots")
library(forcats)
library(mgcv)
library(microbiome)
library(microViz)

 if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
install.packages("BiocManager", type = "binary") # (not binary if you're on linux)
BiocManager::install(c("stringr", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "tibble", "readr", "maps", "glue", "phyloseq", "readxl", "openxlsx", "gplots","forcats", "mgcv", "microbiome" ))



devtools::install_github("david-barnett/microViz")
devtools::install_github("david-barnett/microViz@0.7.2")
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# get some example data
data("dietswap", package = "microbiome")

# create a couple of numerical variables to use as constraints or conditions
dietswap <- dietswap %>%
  ps_mutate(
    weight = recode(bmi_group, obese = 3, overweight = 2, lean = 1),
    female = if_else(sex == "female", true = 1, false = 0)
  )
# add a couple of missing values to show how microViz handles missing data
sample_data(dietswap)$female[c(3, 4)] <- NA

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
